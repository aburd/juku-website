Hello! My name is Aaron Burdick. I've been living in Japan for about four years! I've taught various students throughout the world. From Bolivia, Vietnam, Japan, China, Korea, and other countries. In my time in Japan, I've worked at many schools including Aeon Eikaiwa as well as Waseda University. I hope to have a great time teaching English to you!
